- [ ] Record golden outputs + checksums for optimization validation.
- [ ] Maintain perf regression notes in `FEATURE_PARITY.md` or dedicated doc.

## 10. Dependency Integration (Local /dp Crates)
- [x] Confirm zero direct `tokio` usage in code paths (only via optional deps).

- [x] Use `asupersync` for HTTP + async runtime.
- [x] Use `frankentui` (`ftui`) for CLI rendering.
- [ ] Integrate `beads_rust` for issue/task awareness in CLI or server.

## 12. Publishing & Release (Crates.io + CI)
- [ ] Confirm Cargo metadata (license/readme/repository) for publishable crates.
- [ ] Add crates.io publish workflow gated by tags (`CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`).
- [ ] Document publish order for workspace crates (`cargo publish -p ...`).
